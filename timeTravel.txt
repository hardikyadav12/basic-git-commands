git checkout commit_hash_value -> it will lead us to the specific commit. Here we get a situation of detached head.
normally head points to a branch and the branch points to the commit but after this command..the HEAD points directly to the
specific commit.

git checkout HEAD~1 -> will shift to commit one before the parent one...similarly ~2, ~3 will look to second last, third
last commit and point to that.

git checkout HEAD filename.extension -> this command will shift one commit back on the current branch and then permanent the change
that means you cant recover it. or you can you git restore filename.extension

git restore --source HEAD~2/1/3/4.. filename.extension -> this will move it back to this commit and type git restore filename.extension

git reset commit-hash -> this will go to specifc commit but not remove the value in the .txt file. will also rmove the mistaken commit
git reset --hard commit-hash -> this command will delete the specific cmmit and the value too

git revert commit-hash -> this command will create a new commit instead of deleting the mistaken commit but will also delete the
data
