git checkout commit_hash_value -> it will lead us to the specific commit. Here we get a situation of detached head.
normally head points to a branch and the branch points to the commit but after this command..the HEAD points directly to the
specific commit.

git checkout HEAD~1 -> will shift to commit one before the parent one...similarly ~2, ~3 will look to second last, third
last commit and point to that.
