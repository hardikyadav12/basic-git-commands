When we are working on some branch and we are editing it but suddenly we want to switch to some other
branch for making some change their but dont want to commit anything yet in the current branch..at that time we 
use stashing.

Just practicing stashing!

git stash -> command to pick the changes and store it in the stash
git stash pop - command to revert the changes and paste it back from where it picked it up
git stash apply - command to revert the changes andn paste it in multiple places..is rtue for multiple branches

git stash apply stash@{0} - it will apply this particular stash...you can get the lost of stashe using - git stash list

git stash drop stash@{0} - it will drop this particular stash and git stash clear will clear/delete all the stashes in the list.
